### **Basic SQL Interview Questions and Answers**

1. **What is SQL?**  
   SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is used to perform tasks such as querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data.

2. **What are the different types of SQL commands?**
   - **DDL (Data Definition Language):** `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`.
   - **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
   - **DCL (Data Control Language):** `GRANT`, `REVOKE`.
   - **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`.

3. **Explain the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses.**  
   - `WHERE` filters rows **before aggregation**.  
   - `HAVING` filters rows **after aggregation**.  
   Example:  
   ```sql
   SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
   FROM employees 
   WHERE salary > 3000 
   GROUP BY department 
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
   ```

4. **How do you fetch all the rows from a table?**  
   Use the `SELECT` statement:  
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM table_name;
   ```

5. **What is the difference between `CHAR` and `VARCHAR`?**  
   - **`CHAR`:** Fixed-length storage. Always uses the defined length, padding with spaces if necessary.  
   - **`VARCHAR`:** Variable-length storage. Only uses space for the actual content.  

6. **Explain primary key, foreign key, and unique key.**  
   - **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies a row. Cannot have `NULL` values.  
   - **Foreign Key:** Establishes a relationship between two tables. References a column in another table.  
   - **Unique Key:** Ensures all values in the column are unique. Can have one `NULL` value.

7. **What are constraints in SQL? Name a few types.**  
   Constraints are rules applied to table columns to enforce data integrity.  
   Types:  
   - `NOT NULL`  
   - `UNIQUE`  
   - `PRIMARY KEY`  
   - `FOREIGN KEY`  
   - `CHECK`  
   - `DEFAULT`

8. **What is the difference between `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DROP`?**  
   - **`DELETE`:** Removes specific rows. Can use `WHERE`. Rows can be rolled back.  
   - **`TRUNCATE`:** Removes all rows. Cannot use `WHERE`. Faster than `DELETE`. Cannot be rolled back.  
   - **`DROP`:** Removes the table or database entirely. Cannot be rolled back.  

9. **How do you create a table in SQL?**  
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(50),
       age INT,
       salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
   );
   ```

10. **What is a NULL value? How is it different from zero or an empty string?**  
    - **NULL:** Represents missing or undefined data.  
    - **Zero (0):** A numeric value.  
    - **Empty string (''):** A string with no characters.  
    Example:  
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;
    ```

### **Intermediate SQL Interview Questions and Answers**

---

1. **Write a query to find the second highest salary in a table.**  
   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
   FROM employees
   WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
   ```

2. **How can you fetch only unique records from a table?**  
   Use the `DISTINCT` keyword:  
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
   ```

3. **Explain the difference between `JOIN` and `UNION`.**  
   - **JOIN:** Combines rows from multiple tables based on a related column.  
   - **UNION:** Combines the results of two or more `SELECT` queries into a single result set.  
   Example for UNION:  
   ```sql
   SELECT name FROM employees 
   UNION 
   SELECT name FROM managers;
   ```

4. **What are the different types of JOINs? Provide examples for each.**  
   - **INNER JOIN:** Returns matching rows from both tables.  
     ```sql
     SELECT e.name, d.department_name
     FROM employees e
     INNER JOIN departments d
     ON e.department_id = d.id;
     ```
   - **LEFT JOIN:** Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right.  
   - **RIGHT JOIN:** Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left.  
   - **FULL OUTER JOIN:** Returns rows when thereâ€™s a match in either table.  
   - **CROSS JOIN:** Produces a Cartesian product of two tables.

5. **Write a query to find employees who earn more than the average salary.**  
   ```sql
   SELECT name, salary 
   FROM employees 
   WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
   ```

6. **How do you use subqueries in SQL?**  
   A subquery is a query inside another query.  
   Example:  
   ```sql
   SELECT name 
   FROM employees 
   WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'IT');
   ```

7. **Explain the difference between correlated and non-correlated subqueries.**  
   - **Correlated Subquery:** Depends on the outer query for execution.  
   - **Non-Correlated Subquery:** Can execute independently of the outer query.  

8. **What is an index in SQL? Why is it used?**  
   An index is a database object that improves query performance by allowing faster retrieval of rows. It is like a pointer to data.  
   Example:  
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees(name);
   ```

9. **What are views in SQL? How do you create and use them?**  
   Views are virtual tables based on SQL queries.  
   Example:  
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW employee_view AS 
   SELECT name, department 
   FROM employees 
   WHERE salary > 5000;
   ```

10. **Explain the concept of normalization and its various forms.**  
    - **Normalization:** Process of organizing data to reduce redundancy.  
      Forms:  
      - **1NF (First Normal Form):** Ensures each column has atomic values.  
      - **2NF (Second Normal Form):** Ensures no partial dependencies.  
      - **3NF (Third Normal Form):** Removes transitive dependencies.  
      - **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form):** More stringent than 3NF.

### **Advanced SQL Interview Questions and Answers**

---

1. **Write a query to find duplicate rows in a table.**  
   ```sql
   SELECT column1, column2, COUNT(*) 
   FROM table_name 
   GROUP BY column1, column2 
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

2. **How do you optimize a SQL query for better performance?**  
   - Use proper indexing on frequently searched columns.  
   - Avoid `SELECT *` and query only required columns.  
   - Use joins instead of subqueries wherever possible.  
   - Use `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN PLAN` to analyze query performance.  
   - Avoid unnecessary use of `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY`.

3. **Explain window functions and their applications.**  
   Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. Common functions include `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `SUM()`.  
   Example:  
   ```sql
   SELECT name, department, salary, 
          RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
   FROM employees;
   ```

4. **What is the difference between `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()`?**  
   - **`ROW_NUMBER()`**: Assigns a unique sequential number to rows.  
   - **`RANK()`**: Assigns ranks to rows, with gaps for ties.  
   - **`DENSE_RANK()`**: Assigns ranks without gaps for ties.

5. **How do transactions work in SQL? What are ACID properties?**  
   - A transaction is a unit of work executed as a whole.  
   - **ACID properties:**  
     - **Atomicity:** All or nothing.  
     - **Consistency:** Maintains database integrity.  
     - **Isolation:** Ensures transactions donâ€™t interfere with each other.  
     - **Durability:** Changes are permanent once committed.

6. **Explain the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes.**  
   - **Clustered Index:** Sorts and stores rows physically in order. Only one per table.  
   - **Non-Clustered Index:** Stores pointers to the physical rows. Multiple can exist.

7. **Write a query to fetch the top N rows by a specific column.**  
   - **MySQL:**  
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT N;
     ```
   - **SQL Server:**  
     ```sql
     SELECT TOP N * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
     ```

8. **What is a stored procedure? How is it different from a function?**  
   - **Stored Procedure:** Precompiled SQL code executed with optional parameters. Can perform multiple actions and return zero or more results.  
   - **Function:** Returns a single value or table. Used mainly for calculations.  
   Example Stored Procedure:  
   ```sql
   CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDepartment(@dept_id INT) 
   AS 
   BEGIN 
       SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = @dept_id; 
   END;
   ```

9. **How do you handle deadlocks in a database?**  
   - Use transaction timeouts.  
   - Access resources in the same order in all transactions.  
   - Use shorter transactions to reduce lock duration.  
   - Avoid user interaction during transactions.

10. **Explain CTE (Common Table Expressions) and its benefits.**  
    CTE is a temporary result set defined within a `WITH` clause, used for better readability and reusability.  
    Example:  
    ```sql
    WITH EmployeeCTE AS (
        SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
        FROM employees
        GROUP BY department_id
    )
    SELECT * 
    FROM EmployeeCTE 
    WHERE avg_salary > 5000;
    ```

### **Scenario-Based SQL Questions with Answers**

---

#### **1. Write a query to find the department with the highest number of employees.**
```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department_id 
ORDER BY employee_count DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```
This query groups employees by `department_id`, counts them, and sorts by the count in descending order, returning the top row.

---

#### **2. Given a table with columns `employee_id`, `manager_id`, and `salary`, write a query to find the manager who manages the most employees.**
```sql
SELECT manager_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY manager_id 
ORDER BY employee_count DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```
This groups employees by `manager_id`, counts the employees under each manager, and selects the manager with the highest count.

---

#### **3. Write a query to find all employees who joined in the last 6 months.**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE join_date >= DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL -6 MONTH);
```
This query uses `DATE_ADD` to calculate the date 6 months before the current date (`CURDATE`) and filters employees who joined on or after that date.

---

#### **4. Given a sales table, write a query to find the top 3 products by revenue.**
```sql
SELECT product_id, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue 
FROM sales 
GROUP BY product_id 
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC 
LIMIT 3;
```
This calculates the total revenue for each product, sorts them by revenue in descending order, and returns the top 3 products.

---

#### **5. How do you write a recursive query to find a hierarchy (e.g., employees under a specific manager)?**
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (
    SELECT employee_id, manager_id, name 
    FROM employees 
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL  -- Start with the top-level manager
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id, e.name 
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh 
    ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy;
```

---

### **Miscellaneous SQL Questions with Answers**

---

#### **1. What are stored functions? How are they different from stored procedures?**
- **Stored Functions:**  
  Functions return a single value and are used in SQL expressions.  
  Example:  
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION GetTotalRevenue() RETURNS DECIMAL(10, 2)
  BEGIN
      RETURN (SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM sales);
  END;
  ```

- **Stored Procedures:**  
  Procedures perform multiple operations and can return multiple results but are invoked independently, not within a query.  
  Example:  
  ```sql
  CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeCount()
  BEGIN
      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
  END;
  ```

---

#### **2. What is the difference between OLTP and OLAP?**
- **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):**  
  Used for real-time transactional systems (e.g., banking, e-commerce). Focuses on CRUD operations.  
  Example: Inserting a new order in an e-commerce database.
  
- **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):**  
  Used for analysis and reporting on historical data (e.g., data warehouses). Focuses on queries and aggregations.  
  Example: Generating a sales report by region over a year.

---

#### **3. What are triggers? Provide an example use case.**
- **Triggers:**  
  Automatically executed SQL code in response to events (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) on a table.  
  Example:  
  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER UpdateStock AFTER INSERT ON sales
  FOR EACH ROW
  BEGIN
      UPDATE products 
      SET stock = stock - NEW.quantity 
      WHERE id = NEW.product_id;
  END;
  ```
  **Use Case:** Deduct stock automatically after a sale is recorded.

---

#### **4. Explain the concept of foreign key constraints with cascading actions (`ON DELETE CASCADE`, `ON UPDATE CASCADE`).**
- A **foreign key** enforces referential integrity between tables.  
- **`ON DELETE CASCADE`**: Automatically deletes rows in the child table when the parent row is deleted.  
- **`ON UPDATE CASCADE`**: Updates foreign key values in the child table when the parent key is updated.  
  Example:  
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE orders (
      order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      customer_id INT,
      FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
      ON DELETE CASCADE
      ON UPDATE CASCADE
  );
  ```

---

#### **5. How do you enforce referential integrity in SQL?**
- Use **foreign keys** to link tables.  
- Define constraints to prevent orphaned or inconsistent data.  
  Example:  
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE orders 
  ADD CONSTRAINT fk_customer 
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) 
  REFERENCES customers(id);
  ```
