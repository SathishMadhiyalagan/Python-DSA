### General Python

1. What are Python's key features?
   - Interpreted: No compilation; runs directly from source code.
   - Dynamic typing: Variable types are determined at runtime.
   - High-level: Simplifies complex programming tasks.
   - Object-oriented: Supports classes and objects.
   - Extensive libraries: Includes `numpy`, `pandas`, `requests`, etc.
   - Cross-platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2. Explain Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) and its impact on multi-threading.
   - GIL allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, limiting CPU-bound multi-threading. It doesn't affect I/O-bound tasks.

3. What are Python’s data types?
   - Numeric: `int`, `float`, `complex`.
   - Sequence: `list`, `tuple`, `range`, `str`.
   - Set: `set`, `frozenset`.
   - Mapping: `dict`.
   - Others: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`.

4. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?
   - Shallow copy copies only references for nested objects (`copy.copy()`).
   - Deep copy creates independent copies of all objects (`copy.deepcopy()`).

5. Explain Python's memory management.
   - Uses automatic garbage collection.
   - Reference counting tracks objects.
   - `gc` module can handle circular references.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Functions

6. What are args and kwargs in Python functions?
   - `args`: Allows passing variable-length positional arguments.
   - `kwargs`: Allows passing variable-length keyword arguments.

7. What is the difference between `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and instance methods?
   - `@staticmethod`: Doesn’t take `self` or `cls`; behaves like a normal function.
   - `@classmethod`: Takes `cls` as its first parameter.
   - Instance method: Takes `self` as its first parameter.

8. How do Python decorators work?
   - A decorator modifies a function or class without changing its source code. Example:
     ```python
     def decorator(func):
         def wrapper():
             print("Before function call")
             func()
             print("After function call")
         return wrapper

     @decorator
     def my_function():
         print("Inside function")

     my_function()
     ```

9. Explain the concept of closures in Python.
   - A closure is a nested function capturing variables from its enclosing function's scope:
     ```python
     def outer_function(msg):
         def inner_function():
             print(msg)
         return inner_function
     func = outer_function("Hello")
     func()  # Output: Hello
     ```

10. What are first-class functions in Python?

13. What are metaclasses in Python?
   - Metaclasses control the creation of classes. Example:
     ```python
     class Meta(type):
         def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
             print(f"Creating class {name}")
             return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
     class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
         pass
     ```

         for row in reader:
             print(row)
     ```

20. Explain how to handle exceptions during file operations.
   - Use `try-except` blocks to catch errors:
     ```python

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
Answer:  
OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). Python supports OOP through classes and objects.

---

### 2. What are the main principles of OOP?
Answer:  
1. Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some components.
2. Inheritance: Mechanism to create new classes based on existing classes.
3. Polymorphism: Ability to use a single interface for different data types or classes.
4. Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

---

### 3. What is a class and an object?
Answer:
- Class: Blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of objects.
- Object: Instance of a class.

Example:
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

# Object creation
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
print(car1.brand)  # Output: Toyota
```

---

### 4. What is `self` in Python classes?
Answer:  
`self` refers to the instance of the class. It is used to access variables and methods of the class within its methods.

Example:
```python
class Person:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello! My name is", self.name)

person = Person()
person.name = "John"
person.greet()  # Output: Hello! My name is John
```

---

### 5. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?
Answer:  
- Class Variable: Shared across all instances of the class.
- Instance Variable: Specific to an object.

Example:
```python
class Example:
    class_var = "Class Variable"  # Class variable

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.instance_var = value  # Instance variable

obj1 = Example("Instance 1")
obj2 = Example("Instance 2")

print(obj1.class_var)  # Output: Class Variable
print(obj1.instance_var)  # Output: Instance 1
```

---

### 6. What is inheritance in Python?
Answer:  
Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods of another class.

Example:
```python
class Parent:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Parent!")

class Child(Parent):
    pass

obj = Child()
obj.greet()  # Output: Hello from Parent!
```

---

### 7. What are the types of inheritance in Python?
Answer:  
1. Single Inheritance: One class inherits from another.
2. Multiple Inheritance: A class inherits from multiple classes.
3. Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from a child class.
4. Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes inherit from a single parent.
5. Hybrid Inheritance: Combination of two or more types.

---

### 8. What is polymorphism in Python?
Answer:  
Polymorphism means the same function or method can behave differently based on the object.

Example:
```python
class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        print("Meow")

class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        print("Bark")

def animal_sound(animal):
    animal.speak()

animal_sound(Cat())  # Output: Meow
animal_sound(Dog())  # Output: Bark
```

---

### 9. What is encapsulation?
Answer:  
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods into a single unit and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components.

Example:
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # Private variable

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

account = BankAccount(100)
account.deposit(50)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 150
```

---

### 10. What is abstraction?
Answer:  
Abstraction hides implementation details and only shows essential features.

Example:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14  self.radius  self.radius

circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.area())  # Output: 78.5
```

---

### 11. What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`?
Answer:
- `@staticmethod`: A method that doesn’t take `self` or `cls`. It belongs to the class, but it doesn’t access class or instance variables.
- `@classmethod`: A method that takes `cls` as the first parameter. It can access and modify class variables.

Example:
```python
class Example:
    class_variable = "Class Level"

    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print("Static method called")

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print(f"Class method called, variable: {cls.class_variable}")

Example.static_method()  # Output: Static method called
Example.class_method()  # Output: Class method called, variable: Class Level
```

---

### 12. How is method overriding implemented in Python?
Answer:  
Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method in the parent class.

Example:
```python
class Parent:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Parent!")

class Child(Parent):
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Child!")

obj = Child()
obj.greet()  # Output: Hello from Child!
```

---

### 13. What is the difference between `is-a` and `has-a` relationships?
Answer:  
- `is-a` (Inheritance): A relationship where one class is derived from another (e.g., a Dog `is-a` Animal).
- `has-a` (Composition): A relationship where one class contains another as a part (e.g., a Car `has-a` Engine).

---

### 14. How can you prevent a class from being inherited?
Answer:  
Use the `final` class concept in Python by creating a class using `ABC` and overriding `__subclasshook__`.

Example:
```python
from abc import ABC

class FinalClass(ABC):
    def __subclasshook__(cls, subclass):
        return NotImplemented

class MyClass(FinalClass):
    pass  # Error: Can't inherit from FinalClass
```

---

### 15. How does Python implement operator overloading?
Answer:  
Operator overloading is achieved by overriding special methods (dunder methods) such as `__add__`, `__sub__`, etc.

Example:
```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

p1 = Point(1, 2)
p2 = Point(3, 4)
p3 = p1 + p2
print(p3.x, p3.y)  # Output: 4, 6
```
