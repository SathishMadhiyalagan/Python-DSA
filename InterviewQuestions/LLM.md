### **LLMs & NLP**  

1. **What is an LLM (Large Language Model)?**  
   - An LLM is a deep learning model trained on large amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text.  

2. **How do LLMs process and generate text?**  
   - LLMs use tokenization, embeddings, and transformer-based architectures to predict the next token based on context.  

3. **What are tokenization and embeddings in NLP?**  
   - Tokenization splits text into smaller units (tokens). Embeddings convert tokens into numerical vectors for machine learning models.  

4. **What is the difference between fine-tuning and prompt engineering?**  
   - Fine-tuning updates model weights using labeled data, while prompt engineering crafts inputs to guide model responses without retraining.  

5. **What are attention mechanisms in transformer models?**  
   - Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on relevant words in a sentence, improving context understanding.  

6. **How does the transformer architecture work in LLMs?**  
   - Transformers use self-attention and feedforward layers to process input in parallel and capture long-range dependencies.  

7. **What are pre-trained models, and why are they useful in NLP?**  
   - Pre-trained models are already trained on large datasets, allowing efficient reuse for specific tasks with minimal additional training.  

8. **What is zero-shot learning, and how is it used in LLMs?**  
   - Zero-shot learning enables models to perform tasks they haven’t been explicitly trained on by using general language understanding.  

9. **What is the difference between GPT, BERT, and T5?**  
   - GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) generates text, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) focuses on understanding, and T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) treats tasks as text-to-text problems.  

10. **How does temperature affect LLM text generation?**  
   - Higher temperature makes responses more random, while lower temperature makes them more deterministic.

## **🔹 Steps to Build a Linear Regression Model**  

### **Step 1: Understanding Linear Regression**  
Linear Regression is a **supervised learning algorithm** used for predicting continuous values. It establishes a linear relationship between an independent variable (X) and a dependent variable (y) using the equation:  

\[
y = mx + b
\]

where:  
- **y** = Predicted output (dependent variable)  
- **m** = Slope (coefficient)  
- **x** = Input feature (independent variable)  
- **b** = Intercept (bias)  

### **Step 2: Collecting Data**  
The dataset must contain at least one numerical independent variable (X) and a continuous dependent variable (y).  
Example: A dataset with "Experience in Years" (X) and "Salary in LPA" (y).  

### **Step 3: Data Preprocessing**  
Before training a model, the data should be cleaned:  
- **Handling missing values**: Remove or fill missing data.  
- **Removing outliers**: Detect and handle outliers to improve accuracy.  
- **Feature scaling (if needed)**: Standardize or normalize data if the scale varies.  

### **Step 4: Splitting Data into Training & Testing Sets**  
The dataset is divided into:  
- **Training Set** (80%) – Used for learning patterns.  
- **Testing Set** (20%) – Used for evaluating model performance.  

### **Step 5: Training the Model**  
- The model is fitted to the training data.  
- The algorithm finds the **best-fitting line** by minimizing the error (difference between actual and predicted values) using the **least squares method**.  
- It calculates the best values for **m** (slope) and **b** (intercept).  

### **Step 6: Evaluating Model Performance**  
After training, the model is tested on unseen data. Common metrics:  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.  
- **R² Score**: Indicates how well the model fits the data (closer to 1 is better).  

### **Step 7: Making Predictions**  
Once the model is trained, it can predict outputs for new inputs. For example, given **5 years of experience**, the model predicts the corresponding salary using the formula:  

\[
y = mx + b
\]

### **Step 8: Visualizing Results**  
A scatter plot of actual data points is plotted along with the regression line to check how well the model fits the data.  

### **Step 9: Model Optimization (If Needed)**  
If performance is low, improvements can include:  
- Adding more **features** (independent variables).  
- Using **polynomial regression** for non-linear relationships.  
- Handling outliers or using **regularization** techniques (Lasso, Ridge).

### **🎯 Summary**  
Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful method for predicting continuous values. The key steps include **data collection, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction**. If the model underperforms, it can be improved using feature engineering or advanced regression techniques. 🚀
