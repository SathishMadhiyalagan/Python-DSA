# Python DSA

This repository contains Python implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and utility programs. Each script addresses a specific problem or algorithm to enhance understanding and practice of DSA concepts.

## Project Structure

Below is the list of implemented scripts with brief descriptions:

### Algorithms and Utilities

1. **DutchNationalFlag.py**  
   - Solves the Dutch National Flag problem: rearranging an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s.

2. **FindMinMax.py**  
   - Finds the minimum and maximum elements in an array.

3. **K-thSmallLarge.py**  
   - Determines the k-th smallest and largest elements in an array.

4. **NumberRoman.py**  
   - Converts numbers to their Roman numeral representations.

5. **NumberToWord.py**  
   - Converts numbers to their equivalent English words.

6. **ReverseArray.py**  
   - Reverses the elements of an array.

7. **RomanToNumber.py**  
   - Converts Roman numerals back to numbers.

8. **RotatingKStep.py**  
   - Rotates an array by `k` steps to the right or left.

9. **Sorted.py**  
   - Checks if an array is sorted in ascending or descending order.

10. **StringReverse.py**  
    - Reverses a given string.

11. **SubarraysSums.py**  
    - Calculates sums of all subarrays of a given array.

12. **TwoSumProblem.py**  
    - Solves the Two Sum problem: finds pairs in an array that sum up to a target value.

13. **UnionAndIntersection.py**  
    - Computes the union and intersection of two arrays.
