### **Machine Learning Algorithms**

#### **Decision Tree**
1. **What is a Decision Tree? How does it work?**
   - A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting the dataset into subsets based on feature values, forming a tree structure where each node represents a decision based on a feature.

2. **How are splits determined in a Decision Tree?**
   - Splits are determined using metrics like Gini Impurity, Entropy, or Mean Squared Error (for regression). These metrics evaluate the quality of splits by measuring the homogeneity of resulting subsets.

3. **What are the key parameters in building a Decision Tree?**
   - Max Depth: Limits the depth of the tree.
   - Min Samples Split: Minimum samples required to split a node.
   - Min Samples Leaf: Minimum samples required in a leaf node.
   - Max Features: Maximum number of features to consider for splits.

4. **How do you handle overfitting in Decision Trees?**
   - Use pruning (post-pruning or pre-pruning).
   - Limit tree depth.
   - Set a minimum number of samples per leaf or split.
   - Use ensemble methods like Random Forest.

5. **Explain the difference between Gini Impurity and Entropy.**
   - Gini Impurity measures the probability of misclassification, while Entropy measures the amount of information or disorder in the data.
   - Gini is computationally faster, whereas Entropy provides a more detailed metric.

6. **What is pruning, and why is it important in Decision Trees?**
   - Pruning removes unnecessary branches from the tree to reduce complexity and prevent overfitting. It improves generalization and model performance on unseen data.

#### **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
1. **What is the objective of SVM?**
   - To find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes while minimizing classification errors.

2. **Explain the concept of a hyperplane and support vectors.**
   - A hyperplane is a decision boundary that separates classes in the feature space. Support vectors are the closest data points to the hyperplane, which influence its position and orientation.

3. **What is the difference between a hard margin and a soft margin in SVM?**
   - Hard Margin: Assumes data is linearly separable and does not allow misclassifications.
   - Soft Margin: Allows some misclassifications to handle non-linearly separable data, controlled by a regularization parameter (C).

4. **How do kernel functions work in SVM? Name a few commonly used kernel functions.**
   - Kernel functions transform data into higher-dimensional spaces to make it linearly separable. Common kernels:
     - Linear Kernel
     - Polynomial Kernel
     - Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel
     - Sigmoid Kernel

5. **How would you handle imbalanced datasets when using SVM?**
   - Use class weights to penalize misclassifications of minority classes.
   - Apply oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling techniques.

6. **How does SVM perform in high-dimensional data spaces?**
   - SVM performs well due to its ability to find optimal hyperplanes, but it may be computationally expensive with very high-dimensional data.

### **Deep Learning Algorithms**

#### **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
1. **What is a CNN, and how is it different from a traditional neural network?**
   - A CNN is a specialized neural network for processing grid-like data, such as images. It uses convolutional layers to extract spatial features, unlike traditional networks that rely on fully connected layers.

2. **Explain the roles of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.**
   - Convolutional Layers: Extract features using filters.
   - Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions and computational load (e.g., max pooling, average pooling).
   - Fully Connected Layers: Combine features for classification or regression.

3. **What are the differences between max pooling and average pooling?**
   - Max Pooling: Retains the maximum value from a patch.
   - Average Pooling: Computes the average value from a patch.

4. **How do stride and padding affect the output of a convolutional layer?**
   - Stride: Determines the step size of the filter; larger strides reduce output dimensions.
   - Padding: Adds borders to input data to control output size (e.g., 'same' padding preserves dimensions).

5. **What is a receptive field in a CNN?**
   - The region of input data a neuron in a layer "sees" or is influenced by. Larger receptive fields capture more global context.

6. **How would you apply CNNs in a real-world problem like image classification?**
   - Steps include data preprocessing, designing a CNN architecture, training the model on labeled images, evaluating performance, and deploying the model.

#### **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
1. **What is an LSTM, and how does it differ from a traditional RNN?**
   - An LSTM is a type of RNN designed to handle long-term dependencies by using gates to control the flow of information. It mitigates the vanishing gradient problem seen in traditional RNNs.

2. **Explain the components of an LSTM cell, such as forget gate, input gate, and output gate.**
   - Forget Gate: Decides what information to discard.
   - Input Gate: Decides what new information to store.
   - Output Gate: Determines the output based on cell state.

3. **How do LSTMs handle the vanishing gradient problem?**
   - By using memory cells and gates to maintain gradients over long sequences.

4. **Compare LSTM and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit).**
   - GRU has fewer gates (no separate memory cell) and is computationally efficient.
   - LSTM is more expressive but computationally expensive.

5. **How would you use LSTMs for a time-series forecasting problem?**
   - Use historical data as input sequences, preprocess data (e.g., scaling), and train an LSTM model to predict future values.

6. **What are some real-world applications of LSTMs?**
   - Speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and stock price prediction.

### **Gradient Descent**
1. **What is Gradient Descent, and why is it used in optimization?**
   - Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a loss function by iteratively adjusting model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent.

2. **Explain the differences between batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent.**
   - Batch: Uses the entire dataset for updates.
   - Stochastic: Updates using one sample at a time.
   - Mini-Batch: Uses small subsets of data for updates.

3. **What is the role of the learning rate in gradient descent?**
   - Controls the step size of parameter updates. A small learning rate ensures stability but slows convergence, while a large learning rate risks overshooting.

4. **How can you avoid getting stuck in local minima during optimization?**
   - Use advanced optimizers (e.g., Adam), introduce randomness (e.g., dropout), or use momentum-based methods.

5. **What are exploding and vanishing gradients, and how can they be mitigated?**
   - Exploding: Gradients grow excessively. Mitigated by gradient clipping.
   - Vanishing: Gradients diminish, slowing learning. Mitigated by ReLU activations or advanced architectures like LSTMs.

6. **How do momentum and Adam optimizers improve gradient descent?**
   - Momentum: Accelerates convergence by using past gradients.
   - Adam: Combines momentum and adaptive learning rates for efficient updates.
